## Code of Conduct

We want to foster an inclusive and friendly community around our project. We expect everyone participating in the Lexical Editor Easy community to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/manish-jsx/lexical-editor/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project for development:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm v6 or newer (or yarn)
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/lexical-editor.git
cd lexical-editor
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` to add your Neon PostgreSQL connection string and Vercel Blob token if needed.

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Building the Package

```bash
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized as follows:

```
/src
  /components       # React components
    LexicalEditor.tsx
    EditorToolbar.tsx
    ...
  /plugins         # Editor plugins
  /services        # Service integrations (Blob, Neon)
  /utils           # Utility functions
  /types           # TypeScript type definitions
  index.ts         # Main package exports
/examples          # Example usage
/docs              # Documentation site
/tests             # Test files
```

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Find an issue** to work on or create a new one. Issues labeled "good first issue" are a great place to start.

2. **Create a branch**:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use prefixes like `feature/`, `fix/`, or `docs/` to categorize your work.

3. **Make changes** and follow the coding standards.

4. **Test your changes**:
   - Run unit tests: `npm test`
   - Run lint checks: `npm run lint`
   - Manually test your feature

5. **Commit your changes** following the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add image resize capability"
# or
git commit -m "fix: handle null selection in toolbar"
```

6. **Push to your fork**:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

7. **Submit a pull request** to the main repository.

## Coding Standards

We follow strict standards to maintain code quality:

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Include proper type definitions
- Avoid using `any` type
- Export interfaces for public API components

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Add JSDoc comments for component props
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Use React.memo for performance optimizations when appropriate

### File Organization

- One component per file
- Group related components in a directory
- Include an index.ts file in each directory to simplify imports

### Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names and files
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

### Code Formatting

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. Run before submitting PRs:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

## Testing Guidelines

We use Jest and React Testing Library for testing:

- **Unit tests** - Test individual functions and components
- **Integration tests** - Test interactions between components
- **End-to-end tests** - Test full user workflows

Test files should be placed alongside the component they test with a `.test.tsx` suffix.

Example test structure:

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle specific interaction', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for our project:

- **Code comments** - Use JSDoc comments for functions and components
- **README updates** - Update the README.md with any new features or API changes
- **Documentation site** - Update the docs in the `/docs` directory
- **Examples** - Add examples showing how to use new features

Before submitting a PR, make sure your changes are properly documented.
