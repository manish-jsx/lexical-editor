## How Features Are Organized

Lexical Editor Easy is built with a modular architecture:

1. **Core Components**: The essential editor components (`LexicalEditor` and `EditorToolbar`)
2. **Integration Services**: Services that connect to external systems (Vercel Blob, Neon PostgreSQL)
3. **Utility Components**: Helper components that provide specific functionality (like `BlobImageUploader`)
4. **Plugins**: Components that add features to the editor (like `NeonPersistencePlugin`)

This modular approach allows you to use only the features you need, keeping your application lightweight.
