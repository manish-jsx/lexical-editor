# Troubleshooting

This guide helps you solve common issues you might encounter when using Lexical Editor Easy.

## Installation Issues

### Package Not Found

**Problem:** `npm install` fails with "package not found" error.

**Solution:**

```bash
# Make sure you're using the correct package name
npm install lexical-editor-easy

# If that doesn't work, try clearing npm cache
npm cache clean --force
npm install lexical-editor-easy
```

### Peer Dependencies Missing

**Problem:** Warnings about missing peer dependencies.

**Solution:** Install the required peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install lexical @lexical/react react react-dom
```

For specific integrations:

```bash
# For Vercel Blob support
npm install @vercel/blob

# For Neon PostgreSQL support
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

## Editor Loading Issues

### Editor Doesn't Render

**Problem:** The editor doesn't appear on the page.

**Solution:**

1. Check for JavaScript errors in the console
2. Make sure you're importing the components correctly:

```jsx
import { LexicalEditor } from 'lexical-editor-easy';

// Not
import LexicalEditor from 'lexical-editor-easy';
```

3. Ensure the editor is wrapped in a React component:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <LexicalEditor />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Editor Crashes with Type Errors

**Problem:** TypeScript errors or runtime type errors related to the editor.

**Solution:**

1. Make sure you're using compatible versions of React and Lexical
2. Check that your TypeScript configuration is correct
3. Update to the latest version of the package:

```bash
npm install lexical-editor-easy@latest
```

## Vercel Blob Integration Issues

### Images Fail to Upload

**Problem:** Images don't upload or return errors.

**Solution:**

1. Check that your API route is properly configured:

```jsx
// /api/upload-blob.js
import { put } from '@vercel/blob';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // ...implementation
}
```

2. Verify your environment variables are set:

```
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token
```

3. Check network requests in your browser's developer tools for specific error messages

4. Ensure your Vercel project has Blob Storage enabled in the dashboard

### "Access Denied" for Uploaded Images

**Problem:** Images upload successfully but can't be viewed.

**Solution:**

1. Make sure you're using public access for images that need to be displayed:

```jsx
const response = await uploadToVercelBlob(file, {
  access: 'public',
});
```

2. Check your Vercel project settings for Blob Storage permissions

## Neon PostgreSQL Integration Issues

### Database Connection Fails

**Problem:** Can't connect to the Neon database, errors when saving content.

**Solution:**

1. Verify your connection string is correct:

```
NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@endpoint.pooler.region.neon.tech/database_name
```

2. Make sure your Neon database is active and accessible

3. Check if you're trying to connect from a client-side component incorrectly (should use API routes instead)

4. Try enabling WebSockets for the connection:

```jsx
<NeonPersistencePlugin
  connectionString={process.env.NEON_DATABASE_URL}
  useWebsockets={true}
/>
```

### Content Not Saving

**Problem:** Content changes aren't saved to the database.

**Solution:**

1. Check for errors in the console
2. Verify that your `contentId` is consistent across sessions:

```jsx
<NeonPersistencePlugin
  connectionString={process.env.NEON_DATABASE_URL}
  contentId="consistent-id-123" // Use the same ID to update the same document
/>
```

3. Try increasing the `saveDelay` to ensure changes are complete before saving:

```jsx
<NeonPersistencePlugin
  saveDelay={2000} // 2 seconds
  // ...other props
/>
```

4. Add error handling to see what's going wrong:

```jsx
<NeonPersistencePlugin
  // ...other props
  onError={(error) => console.error('Save error:', error)}
/>
```

## Editor Behavior Issues

### Formatting Commands Don't Work

**Problem:** Buttons like bold, italic, etc. don't apply formatting.

**Solution:**

1. Make sure the editor has focus when commands are issued
2. Check that you're using the built-in `EditorToolbar` or dispatching commands correctly:

```jsx
import { FORMAT_TEXT_COMMAND } from 'lexical';

// In your command handler:
editor.dispatchCommand(FORMAT_TEXT_COMMAND, 'bold');
```

### Content Disappears After Reload

**Problem:** Editor content is lost when the page is reloaded.

**Solution:**

1. Implement persistence with the Neon PostgreSQL integration:

```jsx
<LexicalEditor>
  <NeonPersistencePlugin
    connectionString={process.env.NEON_DATABASE_URL}
    contentId="my-document"
  />
</LexicalEditor>
```

2. Or implement your own persistence mechanism:

```jsx
function EditorWithLocalStorage() {
  const [initialContent, setInitialContent] = React.useState(null);
  
  // Load saved content on mount
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('editorContent');
    if (saved) {
      setInitialContent(saved);
    }
  }, []);
  
  // Save content on change
  const handleEditorChange = (editorState) => {
    const content = JSON.stringify(editorState);
    localStorage.setItem('editorContent', content);
  };
  
  return (
    <LexicalEditor
      initialState={initialContent}
      onChange={handleEditorChange}
    />
  );
}
```
